ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the
 services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware
  abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used
   functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.
    It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing,
     and running code across multiple computers.
